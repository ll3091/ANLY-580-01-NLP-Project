words and music by irving berlin
- from the musical " holiday , nigga ,
he ' s got a lot of knowing so long
she ' s my girl

 she ' ll be living elsewhere
and she ' ll be crying elsewhere
and shell be feeling elsewhere
and she ' ll keep secrets elsewhere
and i ' ll be somewhere thinking about her
and she says
she ' s waiting for you and she ' ll still make you free
but i ' ll still be just fine
and all the instinct you ' ve grown up
and i ' m sick in a white world
but i believe in your eyes
i miss the love that you reach out
but above me , mister , they do
if you ever live there
you just listen and don ' t be no fool

 in a little district
in a neighborhood
people movin ' swift
like they think they should

 a word from your mouth
your lights get knocked out
a blast to take a play
and every fish just a apart
big heavy metal lover
with a long - every game in the ground
